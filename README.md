# oministack_flutter_app

This is the mobile app of the OmniStack week 10 from rocketseat, that I'm making using flutter.

It's a good experience because rocketseat made the app in ReactNative and I'm trying to do the same app in flutter.

But during this week, I also learned how to make apps in ReactNative and get better in React. 

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## Rocketseat

Thanks, and feel free to take a look into this project.
